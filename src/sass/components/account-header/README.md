# Account Header

{{ wip(128) }}

The Account header is used in the [Personal tax account](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/personal-account). It has been specifically designed to provide users with access to the features of the Personal tax account.

{{ example('account-header-example.html', true) }}

## When to use the Account header

If your service is going to be part of the Personal tax account you should use the Account header. 

### When not to use the Account header

You should not use that Account header in stand-alone services, use the [Header](components/header/index.html) instead.

## How the Account header works

The Account header contains:

- [the HMRC cookie banner](/components/header/index.html#the-hmrc-cookie-banner)
- [the GOV.UK header](/components/header/index.html#the-gov.uk-header)
- the [Acount menu](#the-account-menu)
- [the language selector](/components/header/index.html#language-selector) if your service is avalible in Welsh
